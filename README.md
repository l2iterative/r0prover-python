When people talk about accelerating zero-knowledge proofs, there are usually two approaches:
- hardware acceleration
- distributed computation

After years of exploration, many in the industry (including Supranational, Ingonyama) would agree that Nvidia GPU and 
Apple Metal GPU seems to be doing pretty well for hardware acceleration. FPGA and ASIC are still too early to compete, 
and evidence in chip design suggests that FPGA/ASIC are **unlikely** to beat GPU eventually—any idea that can challenge this assertion 
is most welcomed. In fact, [Omer Shlomovits](https://www.omershlomovits.com/) from [Ingonyama](https://www.ingonyama.com/) 
and I have a bounty for breakthrough ideas in hardware acceleration.

This leaves distributed computing. 

The idea is that, if we have a zero-knowledge proof task, we want to distribute it to multiple machines and then aggregate 
their work together. This would require a zero-knowledge proof system that is **distributed-computation-friendly**.
- the different machines involving in the process are **laconic** and **taciturn**, i.e., they have **minimalistic** communication between each other.
- the individual proof work can be merged in an efficient way without severely sacrificing the overall proof generation time

This idea has, however, been systematically studied. 

- [zkBridge](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560652) (ACM CCS 2022), which leads to our portfolio company 
[Polyhedra](https://polyhedra.network/), discovers that an algebraic holographic proof protocol, [Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum (GKR)](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/GKRNote.pdf), 
can be made distributed-computation-friendly by having each machine handle part of the multilinear extensions. 
   * However, committing the input polynomials (through FRI) still has to be done in a federated manner, which is only suitable 
for circuits with small inputs. 
- [Pianist](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2024/313000a035/1RjEaaM09eU) (IEEE S&P 2024) shows that, 
by using [bivariate KZG commitment](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/587.pdf), one can make polynomial commitment 
distributed-computation-friendly, coupled with Plonk (or its variants), which are distributed-computation-friendly, 
one can create fully distributed-computation-friendly proof systems. 
   * However, it requires homomorphic polynomial commitments, for which KZG is but not FRI. But KZG is usually slower.
- all SNARK protocols can be made distributed-computation-friendly through [recursive composition](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/#show-abstract). 
This would incur additional overhead and latency in composing proofs together, but it is a very general approach that 
applies to, technically, any SNARK. 

RISC Zero takes the third approach. The problem with the first two approaches is the same—not working well with FRI, which
still has a prevailing advantage in terms of performance, and the benefit declines if subsequent recursive composition is not avoidable.
For RISC Zero, it is desirable, for Bonsai, to merge proofs from different transactions to lower the on-chain verification 
costs, which means that all proofs would eventually go through recursion, which discourages KZG-based approach.

The third approach reduces the entire acceleration task into a simple step: **coordinate** enough machines to work together.
Tools for this purpose have been extensively studied in machine learning, and we can use two widely adopted frameworks,
[Ray](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/moritz) and [Dask](https://www.dask.org/), here.

### Background in Ray and Dask, two distributed computing frameworks

[Ray](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/moritz) (USENIX OSDI 2018) is a distributed computing framework that 
enables simple remote computation, starting as a UC Berkeley research project. To let two remote clusters to each prove a segment, this can be done with the following 
code.

<img src="https://github.com/ray-project/ray/raw/master/doc/source/images/ray_header_logo.png" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" width="400"/>

```python
import l2_r0prover, ray

ray.init()

# define a Ray remote function
@ray.remote
def async_prove_segment(_segment):
    return l2_r0prover.prove_segment(_segment)

elf_handle = open("elf", mode="rb")
elf = elf_handle.read()
image = l2_r0prover.load_image_from_elf(elf)
input = bytes([33, 0, 0, 0, ...]) # omit the detail input
segments, info = l2_r0prover.execute_with_input(image, input)

# distribute the task using `func.remote(args)`
future_1 = async_prove_segment.remote(segments[0])
future_2 = async_prove_segment.remote(segments[1])

# obtain the results using `ray.get(future)`
receipt_1 = ray.get(future_1)
receipt_2 = ray.get(future_2)
```

[Dask](https://www.dask.org/) is another distributed computing framework with wide adoption. It can be done in a similar manner.
<img src="https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/_images/dask_horizontal.svg" align="right" style="margin: 10px;padding: 80px;" width="400"/>

```python
import l2_r0prover
from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster

if __name__ == '__main__':
  cluster = LocalCluster()
  client = Client(cluster)
  
  elf_handle = open("elf", mode="rb")
  elf = elf_handle.read()
  image = l2_r0prover.load_image_from_elf(elf)
  input = bytes([33, 0, 0, 0, ...]) # omit the detail input
  segments, info = l2_r0prover.execute_with_input(image, input)
  
  # distribute the task using `client.submit(func, args)`
  future_1 = client.submit(l2_r0prover.prove_segment, segments[0])
  future_2 = client.submit(l2_r0prover.prove_segment, segments[1])
  
  # obtain the results using `future.result()`
  receipt_1 = future_1.result()
  receipt_2 = future_2.result()
```
